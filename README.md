## Performance

Rezolver has now been incorporated into @DanielPalme's [excellent IOCPerformance benchmark](http://www.palmmedia.de/Blog/2011/8/30/ioc-container-benchmark-performance-comparison).

Read [our own notes on Rezolver's performance in this benchmark](http://rezolver.co.uk/developers/docs/benchmarks.html), which provide some context on the areas where it can be improved.

> Hint: Unless you're regularly using child containers, Rezolver's performance is right up there with the fastest.
