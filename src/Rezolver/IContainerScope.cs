		//The more extensible solution would be to have an interface which represents the behaviour so that the logic for that behaviour can be abstracted away
		//The difficulty with this being that it means the underlying storage containers for scoped objects used by the scope needs to exposed to implementations
		//of that interface.  The current implementation, for example, uses privately declared concurrent dictionaries and a synchronised list to track objects - this
		//storage would need to be abstracted away.
