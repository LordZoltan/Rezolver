# Objects as Services

Sometimes you will want to create an object yourself and register that in the container for use as
a particular service type.

This is done either by creating an @Rezolver.Targets.ObjectTarget and registering it in a target 
container, or via the extension method(s) @Rezolver.ObjectTargetContainerExtensions.RegisterObject*.
