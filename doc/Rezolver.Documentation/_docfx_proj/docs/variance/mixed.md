# Mixed Variance

If you've read about [covariance support](covariance.md#enumerables), then you'll have seen an example of a covariant
enumerable automatically including different contravariant registrations.

The notes for the example in question refer imply that this is 'mixed' variance.  It's not strictly correct,
however.

> [!TIP]
> In fact, often we'll refer to covariant or contravariant **types** which is not correct either.  A type
> _**parameter**_ is covariant or contravariant, not the type that declares that parameter.S
