# Generic Constructor Injection

*Coming soon*

But, hint: it's basically as you'd expect it to work.  The `RegisterType` extension methods automatically
handle generic types, so you can use them the same as for non-generic types.

This topic will cover not only that, but the more important information about interfaces/bases etc and
how type arguments are mapped from implementation type down to requested generic base/interface.
