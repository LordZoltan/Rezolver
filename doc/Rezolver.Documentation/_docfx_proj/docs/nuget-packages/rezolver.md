# Rezolver Nuget Package

[See package page on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rezolver).

The core nuget package for using Rezolver in your class library or application, includes all the 
core abstractions and classes required to create @TargetContainer objects and @Container objects in your composition root.

Also contains the core @Rezolver.ITarget implementations and logic which allow you to create/retrieve objects using all
the standard techniques (constructor injection, optional member binding, enumerables, delegates and expressions etc)
from the get-go.
