# Rezolver

Welcome to the home of Rezolver - here you'll find guides, walkthroughs, deep-dives and 
reference for all of the APIs and functionality in the Rezolver library.

## What is Rezolver?

Rezolver is (yet another :)) open source IOC container.  It supports many of the features supported by most
other popular IOC containers out there, integrates into the new .Net Core 1.0 framework (supporting the
NetStandard1.1 profile), and supports some unique functionality too.

It's very fast, extensible and reliable, and should slot nicely into any project in which you already have
another IOC container.

### Please note - this documentation is a work in progress!

Rezolver is currently undergoing an API change which has invalidated some of the documentation we had before.

Once everything is built and re-tested, all the documentation will be added ASAP to provide in-depth guides and tutorials
which are then guaranteed to stand the test of time!

So, keep coming back!  We'll get there :)

If you're the kind of person who likes to learn from seeing the code - then check out the [Rezolver repo on Github](https://github.com/LordZoltan/Rezolver),
there are some example applications on there, and you can look at the unit tests to get an idea of how to create and configure containers.
