# Rezolver

Welcome to the home of Rezolver - here you'll find guides, walkthroughs, deep-dives and 
reference for all of the APIs and functionality in the Rezolver library.

## What is Rezolver?

Rezolver is (yet another :)) open source IOC container.  It supports many of the features supported by most
other popular IOC containers out there, integrates into the new .Net Core 1.0 framework (supporting NetStandard1.1) 
(and therefore supports Asp.Net Core), and supports some unique functionality too.

It's very fast, extensible and reliable, and should slot nicely into any project in which you already have
another IOC container.
