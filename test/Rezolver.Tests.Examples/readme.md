# Examples as tests

This project contains numerous Rezolver integration tests whose purpose is to provide working examples for 
our [Developer Documentation](http://rezolver.co.uk).

The code in this project is directly pulled into the various topics throughout that website as code snippets
(rather like Github gists).

When all the tests pass, we know that all the examples we give will be correct.  Also, as a developer, you can
open this project and play with the exact code that we give as an example.

And, of course, if the Rezolver API changes to provide an alternative way to achieve the same thing (or
if there's a breaking change which requires the test to be rewritten), we can simply update the test and 
then the example automatically changes to reflect that.
